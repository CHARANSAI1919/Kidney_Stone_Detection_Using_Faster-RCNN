ðŸ©º Kidney Stone Detection Using Faster R-CNN
This project implements a deep learning-based approach for detecting kidney stones in ultrasound images using the Faster R-CNN object detection algorithm. The model is trained on annotated medical ultrasound images to accurately locate and classify kidney stones, which often appear as small, low-contrast regions in noisy backgrounds.

Faster R-CNN, with its two-stage detection architecture, is well-suited for handling the fine-grained localization required in medical imaging tasks. The goal of this project is to support clinical diagnostics by providing an automated tool to assist radiologists in identifying kidney stones more efficiently and reliably.

ðŸ“„ This work is part of an academic research study on deep learning-based kidney stone detection in ultrasound images.
